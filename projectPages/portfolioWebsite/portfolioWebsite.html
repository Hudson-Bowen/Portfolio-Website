                I was initially inspired to make this website because I wanted a place to document and showcase the projects 
                I have worked on, and felt that there wasn't a great platform for this. I took an introductory HTML and CSS 
                class in high school, so I decided to use the skills I learned to make my own platform to document projects. 
                My goal was to keep the complexity of the code down while making an easy-to-navigate and professional website.
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>
                I started by brainstorming what I wanted the website to look like. I planned for the site to have three main pages:
                Home, which would be the landing page and give some information about me and the site; Projects, which would showcase
                the things I have worked on, and Contact Me, which would show how people can get in touch or view me on other sites.
                I also planned for each project to have its own page where I could put links to the files I used or GitHub 
                repositories, images of the project, and a description of them. After this, I began structuring the website's files.
                I decided that each page would link to two CSS style sheets. One would be an over-arching stylesheet containing 
                general styling for text and classes that could be used across multiple pages. The other would be specifically for 
                that page to make specific changes that would not affect separate parts of the site. After this, I made a git 
                repository to save my progress and started coding.

            <p>
                The first thing I programmed was the navbar. I had never made one before, so I had to look up a few examples to see 
                how to do it. After this, I implemented mine and went through a few iterations and styling before I landed on what 
                is on the website now. It isn't the fanciest thing ever, but  I like its simple and sleek design, so I kept it. Following
                this, I began work on the home page. Here, I made two classes of divs, which I would use throughout the project. I also 
                added an @media rule to make the page look good on smaller devices. Next, I worked on the projects page. The biggest 
                challenge I faced with this page was getting the personal project divs to space out properly, but after some trial 
                and error, I got them to work. The next page I worked on was the individual project page. The most challenging thing 
                I had to program in this project was the image slideshow on this page. I had no clue how to go about this, so after some
                research, I found one that worked well on my site. It required some javascript, which I was trying to avoid because I 
                had never used it in making a website, but after looking at what the code was doing, I was confident I could work with 
                it. This slideshow had one major issue: if you ever expanded the window larger than when you first opened the page, the
                slideshow would bug and show multiple images at once. The fix I found was running a function that adjusts the position
                of the slideshow when the window is resized. I would like a more elegant fix to this, but it works and doesn't cause any 
                other issues, so I left it. Finally, I worked on the Contact Me page. I didn't run into many problems with this page because 
                it is very similar to how the Home page works, so I had to adjust some of the CSS to make the links work correctly.

                For hosting the website, I chose GitHub Pages because it is easy to set up and free. I could have set up a server to host it,
                but I felt that would be a waste of time and money compared to Pages, so I decided against it. Pages also allows me to update
                the website very easily by pushing the changes from my computer to the GitHub repository, saving me time in the long run. After
                I got the website up, the last thing I had to do was buy a domain name and link it to my site, which was pretty straightforward.
